This is the File Database manager project.

to run the code:
    1. run the server.py that is inside the server folder.
    2. run the client.py that is inside the client folder.

Done!!!

I used three classes to make the server working
1. the user handler class
2. the file(database) handler class
3. the actual server class for the connection
